## CONTRIBUTING.md

This document was adapted from the [Altair Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) <br/>

We welcome and value any input, feedback, bug reports, and contributions. In particular, we would especially value feedback on the effectiveness of our functions and/or bug reports. We would also appreciate modification of our functions. 

#### Contributing Examples

Please feel free to create an issue in this repo should you have any questions, would like access to the repo, or to submit a modification of the functions.

- If you notice a bug, or have a feature request, please send us a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_GROUP104_Movies).

- If you want to contribute a modification or bug fix on the functions, you can fork our repo and submit a pull request. The steps to clone our repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/UBC-MDS/ggexpress
```

  The steps to catch up with upstream changes:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/UBC-MDS/ggexpress

git fetch upstream

git merge upstream/master
```
  Then you'll have all the updates in the master branch of your local fork. You can commit changes to your local master branch that are not on upstream and submit a pull request (PR) on GitHub asking to merge your example branch into our project. For details on creating a PR, please see GitHub documentation [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). You can write more details in the PR such as the motivation and purpose of your modification. We will review pull requests within 5 working days and you will get feedback in the PR discussion if anything needs to be changed.
  
All the contributors must obey our Code of Conduct.
